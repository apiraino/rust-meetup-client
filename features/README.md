# Features

This directory contains features to be consumed by a BDD ([Behaviour-Driven Development](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/bdd))
framework. For Rust it's possible to use the industry standard [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io)
as explained [here](https://github.com/acmcarther/cucumber).

Features are written in `.feature` files in the [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference)
language.
